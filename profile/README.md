## Club GitHub Repository Guidelines
Welcome to our club's GitHub repository! This space is where we collaborate and store our code, projects, and documentation. To ensure smooth and productive cooperation, we've outlined some common etiquette and guidelines for proper usage of this repository.

#### 1. Access Request
To access this repository, you must be a club member. If you haven't been granted access yet, please request it from the repository administrator.

#### 4. Branching Strategy
Create feature branches for each new feature, bug fix, or enhancement.
Name your branches descriptively and use dashes to separate words (e.g., feature-login-page).
Avoid pushing directly to the main branch; use pull requests (PRs) instead.

Provide a descriptive title and a summary of your changes in the PR description.
Request code reviews from your team members.
Ensure all automated tests pass before merging.
Resolve any conflicts and address feedback before merging.

Use GitHub issues to report and discuss bugs, new features, and enhancements.
Provide clear and detailed information when creating issues.
Assign issues to team members responsible for addressing them.
Use labels and milestones to categorize and track progress.
#### 8. Code Reviews
Be constructive and respectful when reviewing code.
Focus on the code's quality, readability, and adherence to best practices.
Use GitHub's review features to leave comments and suggestions.
Approve PRs only after they meet the project's standards.

#### 9. Collaboration
Collaborate openly with other members.
Use project boards and GitHub Discussions for planning and discussions.
Share knowledge, documentation, and helpful resources with the team.

If you have questions, need assistance, or have suggestions for improving our GitHub workflow, don't hesitate to reach out to fellow members or the repository administrator. We're here to support each other and make our club's projects a success.
